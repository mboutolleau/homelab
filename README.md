# Homelab

This repo archives various software configuration files and deployment toolkits as well as misc. sysadmin stuff.  
It is mainly used to deploy, configure and maintain a small homelab across a few hosts.

## Ansible

The `ansible` directory contains playbook and roles used across the homelab, see [the README](./ansible/README.md).

## Software

The `software` directory contains various `docker` related configuration files used to deploy software in the homelab, but also misc. related config files. Each sub-directory holds the files for a given piece of software.
